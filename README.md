How to work with the automatic solver.
This modified version of 2048 allows you to run the game with various solving scripts.

How to run one: you need to have a script that solves the game in ./solvers folder
say the name of the solver is DumbSolver.js, to run it you simply need to open

index.html?team=DumbSolver

note the parameter team will specify what script to use to solve the game.
You can also set the speed at which the game will be solved

index.html?team=DumbSolver&speed=100 ( range [ 1 - your maximum magic patience number here ] )

How to build a solver? Here's the simplest example

```
function DumbSolver()
{
  var i = 0;
  
  this.step = function(grid){
    var moves = [];
    i++;
    i%=3; 
    moves.push(i)
    return moves;
  }
}
```
The step function will be called periodically from inside driver.js ( at the speed that you set ).
You receive the status of the grid as a parameter, the cells are stored in the following fashion:
an array of arrays representing the grid, where each array grid[i] is a column.
grid[0] is column 0, grid[1] is column 1, this means grid[0][0] is the element on the first row and first column, 
grid[1][0] first row second column, etc

use this grid to decide your next move or multiple moves. 
return the moves in the order you want them performed in an array []. 
example:
```
var moves = [];
moves.push(0);
moves.push(1);
moves.push(2);
return moves;
```
the moves are mapped as follows:
0 = UP
1 = RIGHT
2 = DOWN
3 = LEFT

Good luck!
